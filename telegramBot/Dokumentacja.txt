*** Telegram Bot Setup and Adding New Sounds ***

Install Telegram App

If you don't have it yet, download and install the Telegram app on your mobile device or computer from the Telegram website.

Create a New Bot

In the Telegram app, search for @BotFather, which is the official bot for creating other bots.
Start a conversation and send the /newbot command. BotFather will guide you through the process of creating a new bot. You will be asked to provide a name for your bot and a unique username (it must end with “bot”).
Upon successful creation of the bot, BotFather will provide you with an API Token. This is a unique key that will allow your script to communicate with the bot. Save it in a safe place.

Part 2: Python Environment Setup

Python Installation

If you don't have Python, download it from python.org and install it, making sure to select the option to add Python to the PATH environment variable during installation.
Python Libraries Installation

Open a terminal or command prompt and install the required libraries by typing:
pip install python-telegram-bot pygame

Part 3: Configuration and Running the Bot Script
Creating the Script

Open a text editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code) and create a new file with the .py extension, for example, telegram_bot.py.
Copy the bot script code that was provided earlier into it. Find the place where you need to enter the bot's API Token and replace the relevant section with the token you received from BotFather.
Adding New Sounds

In the script, you will find the messages_to_sounds dictionary, which assigns specific messages to sound files. To add a new sound, add an entry to this dictionary:

messages_to_sounds = {
"cheese": "cheese.mp3",
"hello": "hello.mp3",
# Add a new message and its corresponding sound here
"your_message": "file_name.mp3",
}

Make sure the .mp3 file is in the same directory as the script.

Running the Script

Navigate to the directory with your script using a terminal or command prompt. Run the script by typing:
python telegram_bot.py

The bot is now active and will play the sound on your computer when it receives a specific message on Telegram.

Part 4: Interacting with the Bot

Starting a Conversation with the Bot
In the Telegram app, find your bot using its username. Start a conversation and try sending defined commands (e.g., “cheese”).
